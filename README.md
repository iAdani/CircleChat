## How to test Firebase 🔥⚾\{ball}
Sending messages from app doesn't work.
To test Firebase notifications: 
1) log into the user from whom you wish to send the message from the swagger's LoginRegister:POST:/api/login function.
2) change the message from swagger's Messages:POST:/api/contacts/{id}/messages function as follows:
   i. id (above request body) should be the recipient's username.
  ii. id (inside request body) should be a new *unique* id for the message. duplicates will not be sent.
 iii. belongs is the username of the sender, and contactUsername is the name of the recipient.
  iv. content is your message's content.
   v. leave created and sent unchanged.
3) press execute.



** Also to mention that we were allowed to pass on doing the landscape part.
